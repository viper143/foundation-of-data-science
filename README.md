Analysis of Average Screen Time by Gender with the help of 
Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Analysis



# Project Synopsis:

This study looks into the connection between teenagers' self-report well-being and their use of digital screens, such as computers, cellphones, video games, and TV. We study the distribution of screen time among participants, its variation by gender, and its relationship to well-being markers like optimism using three datasets using descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. We also look at variations in screen time according to deprivation levels.


#	Used Datasets:

•	Dataset1.csv: Provides demographic data, such as deprivation status and gender.
•	Dataset2.csv: Captures digital screen time information for weekdays (wk) and weekends (we) on various devices (PCs, cellphones, video games, TVs).
•	Self-reported well-being variables (such as optimism, relaxation, and confidence) are included in Dataset 3.csv and are evaluated from 1 to 5.


#	Descriptive Statistics Analysis

Analysis 1: Gender-specific Average Screen Time

Goal: Examine the differences in the average daily screen time between men and women.
Method: Sort the data according to gender, figure out how much time each gender spends in front of the screen, then display the results with a bar chart.

Analysis 2: Indices of Well-Being Distribution

Goal: Examine how measures of wellbeing, including optimism, are distributed.
Method: Determine the frequency of answers for every indication of well-being and use a histogram to display each indicator.










#	Inferential Statistical Analyses

•	Analysis 1: Relationship between Screen Time and Well-Being

Goal: Ascertain whether screen time and measures of wellbeing are significantly correlated.
Method: Discuss the statistical significance of the findings after determining the association between total screen time and well-being markers using Pearson correlation.


•	Analysis 2: Difference in Screen Time according to Deprivation Level

Goal: Determine whether screen time in deprived and non-deprived communities differs noticeably.
Method: To compare the average screen time for the two groups, do an independent t-test. Present the t-test result with statistical significance.


#	Presentation and Visualization

•	The outcomes are shown using:
•	Bar charts to compare the gender-specific average screen time.
•	The distribution of well-being scores is displayed using histograms.
•	T-test and Correlation Coefficients Findings that demonstrate statistical importance.




#	Requirements
•	Python 3.x
•	Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, scipy

#	How to Run the Code
•	Place dataset1.csv, dataset2.csv, and dataset3.csv in the same directory as the script.
•	Run the Python script in your preferred environment (Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, etc.).
•	Ensure all required libraries are installed (use pip install pandas matplotlib scipy if needed).
